## Session: 2026-09-26 (Planning Session)
**Phase:** Pre-Phase 1 (Planning and Architecture)
**Completed:**
- Full project audit: read all existing code, assessed current state vs goals
- Novelty audit: compared against CPGRAMS, Swachhata, IChangeMyCity, CivicSense
- Designed Forced Transparency Engine (FTE) with 4 interlocking mechanisms
- Designed 6 novel features (N1-N6) with algorithms and feasibility ratings
- Created complete plan document set (7 files in plans/ folder)
- Created AGENTS.md workspace rules for session continuity
- Created 8-phase execution roadmap with per-step tracking

**In Progress:** Nothing — planning is complete
**Blocked:** Nothing
**Key Decisions:**
- Chose hash-chain over blockchain (lightweight, sufficient for prototype, no consensus overhead)
- FTE has 4 mechanisms that reinforce each other (hash chain + inaction amplification + adversarial detection + TAS)
- Priority novel features: N1 (Equity), N3 (Adversarial Proof), N4 (Cascade Detection)
- Tech stack confirmed: Express + React + Drizzle + PostgreSQL (already in codebase)
- Rule-based AI baselines first, ML models only after rules work

**Next Session Should:** Say "Start Phase 1" to begin database setup and frontend-backend wiring
**Files Changed:**
- Created: `plans/MASTER_PLAN.md`
- Created: `plans/01-system-architecture.md`
- Created: `plans/02-forced-transparency-engine.md`
- Created: `plans/03-novelty-features.md`

## Session: 2026-09-26 (API Wiring Session)
**Phase:** Phase 1 (Database + Vertical Slice)
**Completed:** 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10
**In Progress:** None
**Blocked:** 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (Waiting for User to install and start Docker Desktop for Postgres)
**Key Decisions:**
- Configured Vite Proxy in PWA to connect to the backend server.
- Used standard `fetch` API for all backend communication in the PWA.
- Wired all major UI pages (Citizen, Officer, Public, MyReports, Home, ReportIssue) to the Express backend.
**Next Session Should:** Start PostgreSQL (via Docker), run Drizzle migrations, start the backend, and test the full vertical slice.
**Files Changed:**
- `nagardrishti-frontend/.env` (created from example)
- `nagardrishti-frontend/client/src/lib/api.ts` (created)
- `nagardrishti-frontend/client/src/pages/citizen/CitizenPages.tsx`
- `nagardrishti-frontend/client/src/pages/officer/OfficerPages.tsx`
- `nagardrishti-frontend/client/src/pages/transparency/PublicPages.tsx`
- `nagardrishti-frontend/client/src/pages/research/ResearchPages.tsx`
- `pwa/vite.config.ts`
- `pwa/src/pages/ReportIssuePage.tsx`
- `pwa/src/pages/HomePage.tsx`
- `pwa/src/pages/MyReportsPage.tsx`
- `plans/05-implementation-roadmap.md`

## Session: 2026-09-27 (Database Setup & Full Wiring)
**Phase:** Phase 1 (Database + Vertical Slice)
**Completed:** 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
**In Progress:** None
**Blocked:** None
**Key Decisions:**
- Replaced Docker Hub MinIO image with `bitnami/minio`, but eventually removed Redis and MinIO temporarily from `docker-compose.yml` to focus purely on PostgreSQL for Phase 1 since they aren't strictly required for startup yet.
- Fixed `dotenv` loading order in the backend (`server/index.ts` and `server/db/seed.ts`) so the backend connects to the correct Docker PostgreSQL instance instead of a fallback.
- Fixed a syntax error in the Officer PWA dashboard search filter logic.
**Next Session Should:** Complete vertical slice issue submission verification.
**Files Changed:**
- `nagardrishti-frontend/docker-compose.yml`
- `nagardrishti-frontend/server/db/seed.ts`
- `nagardrishti-frontend/server/index.ts`
- `nagardrishti-frontend/client/src/pages/officer/OfficerPages.tsx`

## Session: 2026-09-27 (Vertical Slice E2E Bug Fixes & AI Classifier)
**Phase:** Phase 1 (Database + Vertical Slice) — Fully Verified & COMPLETED
**Completed:** 1.1 through 1.10 (Phase 1 is now 100% DONE)
**In Progress:** None
**Blocked:** None
**Key Decisions:**
- Resolved 401 Unauthorized by auto-seeding `demo_role: citizen` in PWA `localStorage` and passing `x-demo-role` in fetch requests.
- Resolved 500 Foreign Key error on `reporter_id` by resolving and caching real UUID from database for demo users in `server/middleware/auth.ts`.
- Resolved 500 UNIQUE collision on `public_ref` by using timestamp + random generation in `issueService.ts`.
- Implemented `/api/ai/classify` deterministic keyword/rule-based endpoint and wired to PWA `ReportIssuePage.tsx` for real-time category predictions.
- Verified end-to-end flow: Citizen PWA issue submission -> PostgreSQL database write -> Audit hash chain event creation -> Public timeline reflection.
**Next Session Should:** Start Phase 2 (PWA Leaflet MapPage, AlertsPage, and Hash-Chain Verification UI/API).
**Files Changed:**
- `nagardrishti-frontend/server/routes/ai.ts`
- `nagardrishti-frontend/server/routes/issues.ts`
- `nagardrishti-frontend/server/middleware/auth.ts`
- `nagardrishti-frontend/server/services/issueService.ts`
